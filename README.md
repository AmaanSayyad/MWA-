# Mental Wealth Academy (MWA)

## Digital Libraries are vulnerable to shutdown. 

Z Library, Ron DeSantis, etc. 
Libraries only have limited copies of audiobooks and limited resources. 
There's no way to actually own books, and Amazon & other companies have taken over with **unfair subscription models.**
There's no way to onboard the next 100,000 users in Web3 with strictly video games, NFTs, and consumer products. We created an individual ERP Platform curated to help onboard mass adoption by 74% by creating value in a with books and rich resources available online, in a decentralized manner

Mental Wealth Academy is the academic knowledge layer of the project and utilizes a focus on connecting resources and a rich ecosystem while building a community of DAO consensus players to participate.

Mental Wealth Academy is a full-scale full-circle ERP educational platform.

## Problem Statement

Access to knowledge and public resources has historically been restricted by centralization, limited access, and corporate-controlled platforms. Public libraries often face shutdowns, limited copies, or corporate competition, while valuable datasets, especially those related to education, science, and climate, are at risk of censorship and reduced accessibility. Current platforms prioritize profit over public service, leaving information isolated and inaccessible to those who need it most.

Mental Wealth Academy (MWA) addresses this issue by creating a community-driven, decentralized knowledge ecosystem. MWA aims to provide resilient, censorship-resistant storage for public datasets, ensuring they remain accessible to all. Our mission is to democratize access to knowledge by building a transparent, DAO-governed digital library and marketplace where public datasets are stored with permanence and resilience.

## Solution

MWA leverages Filecoin’s decentralized infrastructure to store and share large public datasets, with a special focus on scientific research, climate data, and educational resources. By harnessing Filecoin’s tools such as Lassie, Boost, and Lighthouse, we ensure these resources are accessible, resilient, and affordable, offering a powerful alternative to centralized storage solutions.

In addition, MWA’s governance structure, built as a DAO on Polygon, Avalanche, empowers the community to manage resources, vote on new additions, and participate in the platform’s continuous growth. By using Numbers Protocol, we also validate and timestamp resources, ensuring their authenticity and integrity.

## Key Features

1. **DAO-Governed Knowledge Curation**:  
   MWA operates as a community-driven DAO on the Avalanche Network, where members participate in decision-making. Users can vote on new datasets, oversee platform updates, and influence the library’s growth.

2. **Decentralized Storage**:  
   Filecoin’s storage network ensures the permanence and accessibility of MWA’s public datasets. Key tools like Lassie (for data retrieval), Boost (for improved dealmaking), and Lighthouse (for permanent storage) enhance resilience and affordability.

3. **Data Verification & Integrity**:  
   Chainlink oracles verify the authenticity and integrity of datasets on MWA. Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) also ensures fair selection processes for governance actions, fostering trust and transparency.

4. **Incentivized Knowledge Economy**:  
   MWA incentivizes contributions by rewarding users who add valuable datasets, vote on proposals, and participate in community events. This encourages a collaborative ecosystem and drives platform engagement.

5. **Cross-Chain Interoperability**:  
   With Chainlink CCIP, MWA supports NFTs and resources accessible across multiple chains, enhancing compatibility and reach.

6. **Data Permanence with IPFS & Piñata**:  
   By using IPFS and Piñata, MWA ensures data resilience and redundancy, preserving essential documents across a decentralized network.

7. **Numbers Protocol for Media Integrity**:  
   Through Numbers Protocol, MWA timestamps and verifies uploaded media resources, offering trusted, traceable data ideal for researchers, journalists, and archivists.

8. **User Accessibility & Localization**:  
   MWA is designed to be globally accessible with multilingual support and a low-data mode, providing knowledge access for users with limited connectivity.

## Tech Stack

- **Filecoin**: Core storage infrastructure for datasets, ensuring decentralization, affordability, and accessibility.
- **IPFS & Piñata**: Used for decentralized data storage, enhancing redundancy and resilience.
- **Polygon, Avalanche Network**: Hosts MWA’s DAO for community-driven governance.
- **Lassie, Boost, Lighthouse (Filecoin Tools)**: Facilitates efficient data retrieval, storage dealmaking, and permanence.
- **Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation**: Ensures fair governance and automated platform actions.
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Supports cross-chain interoperability for resources and NFTs.
- **Numbers Protocol**: Verifies and timestamps media resources, ensuring traceability and integrity.
- **React & Node.js**: Provides a responsive frontend and scalable backend.

## Future Plans

1. **Mainnet Launch**: Deploying MWA on the mainnet for full-scale impact and increased user access.

2. **Mobile App Development**: Building Android and iOS applications to expand reach and improve accessibility.

3. **AI-Driven Resource Recommendations**: Enhancing the user experience with personalized learning recommendations and auto-tagging for improved discoverability.

4. **Gasless Transactions**: Integrating Biconomy or Moonbeam to support gasless transactions, reducing costs and enhancing accessibility for end-users.

5. **Supporting 50+ New Tokens and 20+ Chains**: Expanding cross-chain compatibility to include a broader range of tokens and blockchain networks.

6. **Grant Funding**: Seeking grants to accelerate development, increase resource accessibility, and expand MWA’s public dataset offerings.
